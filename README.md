### What we do
We have put together a team to provide a replacement for GitHub that:
- is decentralized and distributed, through the use of git functionality
- is free and open-source (FOSS)
- can be used without offering any personal identification
- utilizes open protocols (Nostr and Lightning Network)
- can intuitively manage multiple remote repos within one project
- contains all of the functionality that you need to manage your repos and your projects
- is censorship-resistent
